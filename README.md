# My CTF Writeups in CyberTalents
A collection of CTF writeups and solutions.

# What are CTFs?
A CTF (short for Capture the Flag Competition) is a gamified computer security competition where players solve information security-related challenges to gain points. Although these competitions don’t involve running around to capture a flag, the underlying concept is the same.

In security CTFs, challengers compete to find a flag (usually a long sequence of characters) using modern hacking techniques.

# Types of CTFs
CTFs can be categorized into three main categories:

1. Jeopardy-style CTFs: These are the most popular kind of CTFs which involve solving a set of tasks from varying categories such as web exploitation, reverse engineering, cryptography, etc.
2. Attack-defence CTFs: These involve each team being given their own vulnerable server and services. To succeed, teams must find exploits in and attack their opponents’ networks while protecting their own.
3. Mixed CTFs: These can vary in possible formats and are a mix of the Jeopardy-style and Attack-defence competitions.
